I was tired of seeing empty space all the time. So as you reviewed things I started typing stuff. No real purpose, just words. Words to fill time and space. I wonder if this will word wrap, unlike the code that marches forward into oblivion. I bet you could get some ridiculous lines of code that stretch forward like a... at a loss for a similie that works for that sentence. Also had to google similie and metaphor. And the typing continues! I wonder how long this paragraph of ramblings will get by the end of class. I suppose that depends on if I do this on break too. I doubt I will, I'll probably jam to some Wings. "Love take me down to the streets..." Thats Wings right? Now I need to download Role Models too, actually Im pretty sure I have it on Vudu. I love Vudu. Which takes me to Dead Island in my head. I wonder what Im going to play with Senor Mitch tonight. Im pretty cool with Saints Row or Dead Island or Diablo 3. Crap, I apparently do not have Role Models on there. I really thought I did. Im skeptical and am going to look again. My memory seems to think I did, but I dont.
